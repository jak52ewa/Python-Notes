#Boolean Values

'''
The answers to the questions computers ask
have only two possible values: True or False.
Python calls these two values Boolean values,
and they must always start with a capital letter.
You can store a Boolean value in a variable.

answer_one = True
answer_two = False

print(answer_one)
