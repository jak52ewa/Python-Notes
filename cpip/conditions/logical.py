Equals signs
In Python, you can use a single equals sign, =, or a double
equals sign, ==. They mean slightly different things. Use
a single equals sign when you want to set the value of a
variable. Typing age = 10, for example, sets the value of
the variable age to 10. Use a double equals sign when
you want to compare two values, as in the example below.
