What is an Algorithm?

Set of steps taken to solve a specific problem is called Algorithm.

 * Algorithm complexity
    Space complexity: How much memory does it require?
    Time complexity: How much time does it take to complete?
 * Inputs & Outputs
    What does the algorithm accept, and what are the results?

 * Classification
    Serial/parallel, exact/approximate,
    deterministic/non-deterministic

Understanding Algorithm Performance

 * Measure how an algorithm responds to dataset size
 * Big-O notation (Used to describe algorithm performance)
    Classifies performance as the input size grows
    'O' indicates the order of operation: time scale to perform an operation
     (worst case scenario of how long it takes to perform a given operation)
 * Many algorithm and data structure have more than one O
    Inserting data, searching for data, deleting data, etc.
     (each of which has there own order of operation)

Common Big-O Terms

 Notation       Description     Example
 O(1)           Contant Time    Looking up a single element in an array
 O(log n)       Logarithmic     Finding an item in a sorted array with a
                                binary searching
 O(n)           Linear time     Searching an unsorted array for a specific
                                value
 O(n log n)     Log-Linear      Complex sorting algorithm like heap sorted 
                                and merge sort
 O(n^2)         Quadratic       Simple sorting algorithm, such as bubble
                                sort, selection sort, and insertion sort
