What is an Algorithm?

Set of steps taken to solve a specific problem is called Algorithm.

* Algorithm complexity
    Space complexity: How much memory does it require?
    Time complexity: How much time does it take to complete?
* Inputs & Outputs
    What does the algorithm accept, and what are the results?

* Classification
    Serial/parallel, exact/approximate,
    deterministic/non-deterministic
